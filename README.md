Appointment Reminder System

The Appointment Reminder System is a robust, extensible Python application designed to automate the process of sending appointment reminders for clinics, hospitals, and other healthcare providers. It supports multiple communication channels—including Email, SMS, and WhatsApp—ensuring that both patients and doctors are promptly notified about upcoming appointments.

Features

                                                     - **Automated Reminders:** Automatically sends reminders to patients and doctors ahead of scheduled appointments.
                                                    - **Multi-Channel Support:** Out-of-the-box support for Email, SMS, and WhatsApp notifications. Easily extendable to add more channels.
                                                    - **Duplicate Prevention:** Tracks reminders sent to avoid sending duplicate notifications for the same appointment.
                                                    - **Structured Appointment Management:** Appointments are stored in a structured, easily manageable format.
                                                    - **Logging:** Comprehensive logging for all reminder activities, errors, and system events for easy monitoring and troubleshooting.
                                                    - **Integration Ready:** Designed to integrate with external clinic management systems (via API, CSV, or database).
                                                    - **Customizable Scheduling:** Uses the `schedule` library to run reminder checks at configurable intervals.

                                                    How It Works

                                                    1. **Define Appointments:** Appointments are stored as dictionaries in a list, including patient/doctor details, contact information, and preferred communication channel.
                                                    2. **Configure Channels:** The system uses a unified interface for sending reminders. Email uses SMTP, while SMS and WhatsApp are powered by Twilio.
                                                    3. **Send Reminders:** At scheduled intervals, the system checks for upcoming appointments and sends reminders via the specified channel.
                                                    4. **Track Responses:** Optionally, the system can prompt for and record acceptance or decline responses from patients and doctors.
                                                    5. **Logging:** All actions are logged to a file for auditing and debugging.
